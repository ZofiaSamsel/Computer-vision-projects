# Computer-vision-projects
Projects developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence course 

Programs were written in p5.js. In some Teachable Machine was used (https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/). 

# Project 1) **Background Filter** 

Program that allows you to recognize the outline of a person and change the background behind them. 

# Project 2) **Clown Mask, Face and Body recognition**

Used BodyPix for body segmentation and PoseNet to collect the person's position in the camera. 
The program allows real-time detection of the person in the camera. Two scenarios were created:

  1) clicking the mouse button - allows a clown mask to be placed on the person 
  2) clicking the 'S' key on the keyboard - allows points to be applied to the person's body and gloves to the hands 

# Project 3) **Pose recognition JOJO**

The project uses a computer vision model created in Teachable Machine Pose.  It allows the recognition of 6 characteristic poses of the characters from the JOJO Bazzar Adventure series. When a person does the corresponding pose, a graphic associated with the character appears on the screen. In addition, the SPACE button can be used to display a group graphic of the JOJO cartoon characters. 

To enable the program, the main sketch.js file must be activated. 
 
# Project 4) **Poster with dogs and sounds effect**

A project to display two graphics of dogs and to activate the corresponding sounds by clicking the "S" key. 

# Project 5) **Sound_Detection** 

The project was created using the Teachable Machine Audio model.
The project allows the recognition of 4 sounds (rattle, harmonica, whistle, clap) and background sounds. When the corresponding sound is recognized, graphics and sound are displayed.
